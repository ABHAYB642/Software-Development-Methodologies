# Pair Programming

<img src="/images/PairProgramming/Pair.jpg"/>

Pair programming is an agile software development technique  originating from Extreme Programming (XP)in which two programmers work together. The goal of agile software development is to deliver software on an ongoing basis so the results can be evaluated more easily. The two people work together to design, code and test user stories. Ideally, the two people would be equally skilled and would each have equal time at the keyboard.

Pair programming is a great educational tool for beginners. Observing other programmers and writing code in front of them are great ways to improve your problem-solving skills.

It’s also a good introduction for programmers who are onboarding with a new company. Learning about ongoing projects by working on them with an experienced and knowledgeable team member can help you stay up-to-date with programming practices. It also keeps individuals from becoming isolated from the rest of the team or project.

In Pair programming two software developers share a single workstation and work together to develop a single feature. It is a practice that is used in scrum teams.

One programmer, <b>the driver</b>, writes the code, while the other, <b>the navigator</b>, reviews the code as it’s written and provides feedback. The two programmers switch roles periodically while working. For pairing to be effective, the workstation needs to be able to accommodate both programmers – the desk should have enough room to easily accommodate at least two chairs. The room’s noise level should be controlled and should not be any louder than the muted conversation of the individual pair or multiple pairings.

This method may not only be used for programmers writing code but works for almost all industries and roles.

This Agile software development technique is not well suited for everyone, however. Learning to partner effectively in a team that close and share a work computer takes skills that not all programmers possess. It requires both programmers to have the soft skills required for collaboration, as well as the requisite hard skills to write and test code. Some businesses may adopt the practice, while others may opt not to use it.

## Benefits of Pair Programming:
* Results in higher quality code/products.
* Increases shared knowledge/skill transfer.
* Promotes T-shape of team members.
* Encourages communication & teamwork.
* Clarifies problems and speeds up the decision-making process.

Here are some of the reasons why organizations use pair programming:

* <b>Knowledge sharing</b>
<p>While everyone on a project strives to be knowledgeable, there may be one or two programmers who hold the most knowledge of a project’s codebase. These people are sometimes called “towers of knowledge,” and teams may rely on them heavily. This becomes an issue if progress comes to a halt when those people are unable to work due to sickness or other causes.</p>

<p>Pair programming can ensure that one or two people aren’t holding all the knowledge critical to a project. Pairing them with a variety of programmers helps spread knowledge and keeps them from burning out.</p>

* <b>Thinking</b>
<p>Writing code is only a small piece of what programmers do. Most of their time is spent solving problems, so having another programmer to bounce ideas off of and brainstorm with is invaluable.</p>

<p>You can come up with more creative solutions than you would on your own, and you might find solutions faster. Just having someone to talk through a problem with can be key to coming up with a solution.</p>

* <b>Focus</b>
<p>It’s easy for your mind to wander when you’re working on your own. Having another person with you and changing roles often can help keep you fresh and focused.</p>

* <b>Accuracy</b>
<p>Having someone quality checking the code as it’s being written will improve accuracy. Issues and bugs can be caught immediately rather than down the road when it’s harder to debug. This system makes it easier to improve code as well.</p>


## Challenges of pair programming

* <b>More complexity</b>
<p>Tasks often done by only one person tend to be simpler than those assigned to two people. For these complicated tasks assigned to a pair, an approach should be created and agreed upon.</p>

<p>Forming the best approach to a problem adds an extra layer of complexity and requires an extensive amount of time and thought. Ideally, programmers will have enough time to work on solo and pair-programming tasks.</p>

* <b>Fatigue</b>
<p>When you’re working on your own, you can take breaks and work at your own pace. That’s more difficult when you’re working in a pair, so it’s important to discuss break schedules with your pair programming partner.</p>

*<b> Managing skill levels</b>
<p>If there’s a significant gap in skill level between the two partners, one might end up relying too heavily on the other. This could lead to issues with workflow and between programmers.</p>

<p>It’s important for both partners to be open-minded and give the other person a chance to write code, make mistakes, and correct themselves. For example, if the driver makes an error, give them several seconds to correct it before pointing it out.</p>

* <b>No alone time</b>
<p>Some tasks need to be done on your own, like email or returning phone calls. Expecting a pair to work together all the time is unrealistic and could lead to burnout. Instead, make it a consistent part of a schedule that includes time to work alone.</p>

<p>Many organizations use pair programming for improved efficiency. Even if you’re still learning to code, pair programming is a good way to improve your skills. For example, if you’re new to Java, you might want to practice with another student learning Java (or someone more experienced).</p>
