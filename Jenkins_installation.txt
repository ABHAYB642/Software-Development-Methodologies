How to Manually Install Jenkins on Linux

sudo apt update

1.Install Java: Jenkins requires Java to run.
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk

2.Download the Jenkins WAR file.
sudo wget https://updates.jenkins-ci.org/latest/jenkins.war

3.Start Jenkins.
java -jar jenkins.war


4.Access Jenkins: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the Jenkins web interface.

5.Complete the setup: Follow the instructions on the Jenkins setup screen to complete the installation process. To obtain the initial passwod, run:
 cat /home/clouduser/ .jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword


5.If port 8080 is already in use on your system, you can specify a different port using the --httpPort option when starting Jenkins. For example, to start Jenkins on port 9090, you can use the following command:

java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=9090

these steps help you to install Jenkins manually



4. The setup prompts to either Install suggested plugins or Select plugins to install. Itâ€™s fine to simply install the suggested plugins.
You can always install more plugins later. The system continues the initial Jenkins setup.


5. The next step is the Create First Admin User. Enter the credentials you want to use for your Jenkins administrator, then click Save and Continue.


6. After this, you should set up the Instance Configuration. This is the preferred network address for this Jenkins installation. Confirm the address you want to use for your server. This is most likely the same address you used to get to this configuration page.Once you specify the Jenkins URL, click Save and Finish.



7. You should see a page that says Jenkins is ready! Click Start using Jenkins to open the Jenkins dashboard.
