### Requirement Elicitation Techniques

Requirements Elicitation is the process to find out the requirements for an intended software system by communicating with client, end users, system users and others who have a stake in the software system development.

There are various ways to discover requirements

- Interviews:

Interviews are strong medium to collect requirements. 
Organization may conduct several types of interviews such as:

1.Structured (closed) interviews, where every single information to gather is decided in advance, they follow pattern and matter of discussion firmly.
2.Non-structured (open) interviews, where information to gather is not decided in advance, more flexible and less biased.
3.Oral interviews
4.Written interviews
5.One-to-one interviews which are held between two persons across the table.
6.Group interviews which are held between groups of participants. They help to uncover any missing requirement as numerous people are involved.


- Surveys:

Organization may conduct surveys among various stakeholders by querying about their expectation and requirements from the upcoming system.

- Questionnaires:

A document with pre-defined set of objective questions and respective options is handed over to all stakeholders to answer, which are collected and compiled.

A shortcoming of this technique is, if an option for some issue is not mentioned in the questionnaire, the issue might be left unattended.

- Task analysis:
eam of engineers and developers may analyze the operation for which the new system is required. If the client already has some software to perform certain operation, it is studied and requirements of proposed system are collected.

- Domain Analysis
Every software falls into some domain category. The expert people in the domain can be a great help to analyze general and specific requirements.

- Brainstorming
An informal debate is held among various stakeholders and all their inputs are recorded for further requirements analysis.

- Prototyping
Prototyping is building user interface without adding detail functionality for user to interpret the features of intended software product. It helps giving better idea of requirements. If there is no software installed at client’s end for developer’s reference and the client is not aware of its own requirements, the developer creates a prototype based on initially mentioned requirements. The prototype is shown to the client and the feedback is noted. The client feedback serves as an input for requirement gathering.

- Observation
Team of experts visit the client’s organization or workplace. They observe the actual working of the existing installed systems. They observe the workflow at client’s end and how execution problems are dealt. The team itself draws some conclusions which aid to form requirements expected from the software.


## Software Requirements Characteristics

Gathering software requirements is the foundation of the entire software development project. Hence they must be clear, correct and well-defined.

A complete Software Requirement Specifications must be:

	Clear
	Correct
	Consistent
	Coherent
	Comprehensible
	Modifiable
	Verifiable
	Prioritized
	Unambiguous
	Traceable
	Credible source

## Software Requirements
We should try to understand what sort of requirements may arise in the requirement elicitation phase and what kinds of requirements are expected from the software system.

## Functional Requirements
Requirements, which are related to functional aspect of software fall into this category.

They define functions and functionality within and from the software system.

Examples -
- Search option given to user to search from various invoices.
- User should be able to mail any report to management.
- Users can be divided into groups and groups can be given separate rights.
- Should comply business rules and administrative functions.
- Software is developed keeping downward compatibility intact.

## Non-Functional Requirements
Requirements, which are not related to functional aspect of software, fall into this category. They are implicit or expected characteristics of software, which users make assumption of.

Non-functional requirements include -

- Security
- Logging
- Storage
- Configuration
- Performance
- Cost
- Interoperability
- Flexibility
- Disaster recovery
- Accessibility

### Requirements are categorized logically as

- Must Have : Software cannot be said operational without them.
- Should have : Enhancing the functionality of software.
- Could have : Software can still properly function with these requirements.
- Wish list : These requirements do not map to any objectives of software.

While developing software, ‘Must have’ must be implemented, ‘Should have’ is a matter of debate with stakeholders and negation, whereas ‘could have’ and ‘wish list’ can be kept for software updates.
