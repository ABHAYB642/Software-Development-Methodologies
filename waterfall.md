# Waterfall Model

<img src="/images/waterfallmodel.png"/>

Waterfall model was the first model which was widely used in the software industry.
It is divided into phases and the output of one phase becomes the input of the next phase. It is mandatory for a phase to be completed before the next phase starts. In short, there is no overlapping in the Waterfall model Each phase of the waterfall model is quite precise and well-defined.  

In waterfall, the development of one phase starts only when the previous phase is complete. Because of this nature,Since the phases fall from a higher level to a lower level, like a waterfall, Itâ€™s named the waterfall mode.

### The activities involved in different phases are as follows:

5. Perform a sanity check in the environment after the application is deployed to ensure the application does not break. <br/>
